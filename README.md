was gonna make a whsmith but then realised i had to make a website, i didnt want to learn react, i dont like web dev

i called it Kinesthesia, after a project by my good friend

# SHAOLINTEMPLE2

learning rust because i want to make an app in rust, i wont spoil the idea

legit just a text interface, nothing crazy

# Express_Eval

so i feel a little better with rust, made this, so you type in an expression, and it calculates it, only basic stuff +/*- and parenthesis

used regex, still the same as java. nothing special. learned shunting yard algorithm. reverse Polish notation 






 so this here is me documenting progress in rust, its just something i want to do in my spare time, i dont know if ill get far but yk
