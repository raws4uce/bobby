 so this here is me documenting progress in rust, its just something i want to do in my spare time, i dont know if ill get far but yk
 

# bobby (greatest dog)
the book store (will not lie just a spring boot tutorial but i understand it or so i keep telling myself)

was gonna make a whsmith but then realised i had to make a website, i didnt want to learn react, i dont like web dev

i called it Kinesthesia, after a project by my good friend

# SHAOLINTEMPLE2

learning rust because i want to make an app in rust, i wont spoil the idea

legit just a text interface, nothing crazy

# Express_Eval

so i feel a little better with rust, made this, so you type in an expression, and it calculates it, only basic stuff +/*- and parenthesis

used regex, still the same as java. nothing special. learned shunting yard algorithm. reverse Polish notation 

# Minigrep (not going to add because its pointless)

was gonna make this (btw the way ive been learning rust was the book, and chat gpt prompts so like, make a little project idea of something)

basically my ego is getting the better of me and i gave up after briefly smelling the chapter

*the plan*
# BST

its a bst, honestly chatgpt is wicked at making test cases, i was struggling on delete fn 


# tree

avl tree, rotation was a real challange, cheatsheet is the plug, fyi i did this all in java a while ago, it was a matter of synthax rather than knowing stuff. battles with the borrow checker

im gonna make a dbms, so im gonna learn how to do that

# kvs (KeyValueStore, as simple as databases go)

project2 in talent plan. im a little proud, skipped comp because i want to move on TODO compilation, using anyhow{Result}

# *burn bridge when we get to it*
